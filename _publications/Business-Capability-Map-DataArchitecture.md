Capability is an abstract concept by design and misunderstood by me in the beginning. I have seen this tool used to great value in many places, and a money pit in a few. However it is by far the most accepted artifact by the business and a great tool to gain a clear understanding of the functional areas and domains. They serve as a foundation for decision-making related to business transformation, process improvement, organizational restructuring, and IT initiatives.

Mapping Data Domains to organization departments directly can be a political nightmare and messy. However, BCMs have already solved a similar problem by providing a cross-functional perspective, meaning they span across different departments or functional areas of the organization. Organizations have come to understand and buy into these BCMs and recognize how departments interact and depend on each other through capabilites.

I find business capability typically corresponds to specific data domains or areas of data ownership. For example, a "Customer Management" ***capability aligns and maps*** with data domains related to customer data, such as customer master profiles and and customer preferences. Within each business capability we would then add a new dimension to define ***data ownership responsibilities***. Data ownership includes accountability for data quality, accuracy, security, and compliance within that domain.

Before we dive into how they relate to Data Domain ownership, I have some main takeways on successfully developing Business Capability Maps.

>Implementation Tip: Embrace the principle Good is good enough. Work our way up from an industry model and donâ€™t get caught in a paralysis for perfection. It should be left at a strategic planning level and not worry too much of decomposing capabilities down too much.

>Implementation Tip: Being an abstract concept it does not need to change too often. Hence this is ideal to align relatively volatile organization structures, Programs, IT Functions etc to each other.

>Implementation Tip: Use the capability map in conjunction with other strategic planning tools such as Target Operating Models, Long term planning and other strategic analysis tools. By relating the capability map to other tools adds relevance and insights to the overall strategy planning.

>Implementation Tip: Focus on specific and tangible outcomes. The capability map and can be multiple things but never all at once. It can be both a tool for M&A as one of the respondents suggested or it can be used to optimize your IT portfolio [invest buy vs invest build vs outsource]. Having it do both, will add complexity and leave a bad taste to the mouth.

>Implementation Tip: Value is in the insights and not how pretty it looks. So rather than focusing on tooling and canvas focus on how we can articulate data and measures. Simple heat mapping can go a long enough way.
