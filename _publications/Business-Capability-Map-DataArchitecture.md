Business Capability Map
Capability is an abstract concept by design and misunderstood by me in the beginning. I have seen this tool used to great value in many places, and a money pit in a few. However it is by far the most accepted artifact by the business and a great tool to gain a clear understanding of the functional areas and domains. Before we dive into how they relate to Data Domain ownership, I have some main takeways on successfully developing Business Capability Maps.

>Embrace the principle Good is good enough. Work our way up from an industry model and donâ€™t get caught in a paralysis for perfection. It should be left at a strategic planning level and not worry too much of decomposing capabilities down too much.
>Being an abstract concept it does not need to change too often. Hence this is ideal to align relatively volatile organization structures, Programs, IT Functions etc to each other. 
>Use the capability map in conjunction with other strategic planning tools such as Target Operating Models, Long term planning and other strategic analysis tools. By relating the capability map to other tools adds relevance and insights to the overall strategy planning.
>Focus on specific and tangible outcomes. The capability map and can be multiple things but never all at once. It can be both a tool for M&A as one of the respondents suggested or it can be used to optimize your IT portfolio [invest buy vs invest build vs outsource]. Having it do both, will add complexity and leave a bad taste to the mouth.
>Value is in the insights and not how pretty it looks. So rather than focusing on tooling and canvas focus on how we can articulate data and measures. Simple heat mapping can go a long enough way.
