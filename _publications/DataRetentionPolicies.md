An example of a policy statement (very close to a real one which I was responsible in creating)

#Security Measures:
Access Controls: Implement strict access controls to archived data to prevent unauthorized access.
Encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data during storage and transmission.


Data Classification:
Critical Data: Essential for business operations, high security, and compliance requirements.
Sensitive Data: Contains personal or confidential information.
Non-Critical Data: Routine business data with low impact if lost.
Retention Periods:
Legal and Regulatory Requirements: Define minimum retention periods based on laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Business Requirements: Determine retention based on business needs, such as financial records, customer data, and operational data.
Retention Rules:
Start Date: Specify the date from which the retention period starts (e.g., creation date, last accessed date).
End Date: Define the end of the retention period and criteria for deletion or archiving.
Archiving Procedures:
Archival Format: Ensure data is archived in a format that maintains integrity and is accessible over time.
Storage Solutions: Utilize cost-effective storage solutions (e.g., cloud storage, cold storage).

Data Deletion:
Deletion Protocols: Establish secure deletion protocols to ensure data is irretrievably deleted after the retention period.
Verification: Implement processes to verify data deletion and maintain audit trails.
Monitoring and Compliance:
Audits: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with retention policies.
Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring tools to track data access, retention periods, and compliance status.
Documentation and Training:
Policy Documentation: Clearly document retention policies and procedures.
Training: Provide regular training to employees on data retention policies and compliance requirements.
Review and Update:
Periodic Reviews: Regularly review and update retention policies to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and business needs.
Feedback Mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from stakeholders for continuous improvement.
Implementing detailed retention policies ensures data is managed effectively, meeting both compliance requirements and business needs.
