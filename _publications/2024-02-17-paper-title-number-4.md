At the core Data Fabric, it is striving to reduce time to data integration and interoperability.
    - use a consistent metadata standards to realize  
        - unified data
        - semantic data.

1. Describe: What the data is.
    * Unified Data Model: An inclusive data model which 
        * consolidates commonalities 
        * accommodates exclusivities.
    * Data Catalog
2. Organize: 
    * Unified Data: is when many fragmented data sources are merged into one logical data set based on the unified data model.
    * Resource URI & URI Endpoints (URL)
3. Share:  
    * Uniform Interface: Data across the enterprise needs to be accessed via a uniform interface.
        * REST Architecture with Uniform Interface: 
        * HTTPS
        * JsonSchema
        * Open API
        * GraphQL
4. Integrate:  
    * Semantic Model with self described Data Integration: 
        * Hypermedia with linked relationships, RDF, Graphql
