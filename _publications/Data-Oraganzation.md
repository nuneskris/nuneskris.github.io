I did my Master Thesis on measruing architecture programs in an enterprise. This had instilled in me to measure everything. Most measurements dont exactly potray a reality or estimate exactly what is to happen. But it is definately better than not having any. [In a page on Data Domains](https://nuneskris.github.io/publication/Domain-Oriented-Business-Capability-Map), I recommended to build data domains around business capability maps to support federated data management and governance. However there needs to be consistency on what we measure and how we measure these data domains.\

An example of a data domain and a few measure are shown below.
