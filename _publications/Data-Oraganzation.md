During my Master’s thesis, I focused on measuring architecture programs within enterprises, which ingrained in me the importance of measurement in all aspects of work. While most metrics may not perfectly capture reality or predict outcomes with complete accuracy, they are certainly better than having no metrics at all.

[In a page on Data Domains](https://nuneskris.github.io/publication/Domain-Oriented-Business-Capability-Map), I recommended building data domains aligned with business capability maps to support federated data management and governance. However, it’s crucial to ensure consistency in what we measure and how we measure these data domains.

As part of a large transformation program, I was tasked with developing a framework to assess our current position and create a roadmap for where we need to go. I quickly realized that this was a politically sensitive endeavor. Rather than relying solely on financial metrics, which are typically used at a portfolio level, we needed a method to provide a more holistic perspective on data management.

To achieve this, I employed a four-point scale to evaluate various dimensions of the architecture, as well as its lifecycle stages, from the current state (as-is) to full implementation.

Below is an example of a data domain and some of the metrics used to assess it.
