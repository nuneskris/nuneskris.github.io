Data is stored and managed in desperate data stores and are not automatically integrated together. 

Integrated data refers to the process of combining data from different sources and providing a unified view. This process is crucial for organizations that need to analyze data from multiple systems or departments to make informed decisions. Integrated data ensures consistency, accuracy, and completeness by merging data into a cohesive dataset.

Different systems are designed and built in isolation, and stores data in native datamodel schemas and formats. 

# The same data is defined inconsistently in these systems.

Lets take Customer Data. 

## Inconsistent Identifiers: 
A very common challenge we would encounter is different departments (Sales, Marketing, Customer Support)  might use different customer IDs or formats for the same customer. For example, Sales might use "C12345," while Marketing uses "JD-5678."
## Redundant Systems Across Multiple Business Lines: 
It is very common to have customers managed seperately in redundant systems across business lines. This is happens particularly during M&As. There are multiple MDM projects just to deal with this integrations.
## Varying Data Formats: 
The address in the Sales database might be complete with street, city, state, and zip code, whereas the Marketing database might only store city and state. This inconsistency makes it difficult to match records accurately.
Redundant and Conflicting Data: The same customer's name might be stored differently across departments (e.g., "John Doe" vs. "Doe, John"), leading to redundancy and potential conflicts when merging data.
## Different Data Attributes: 
Departments might store different attributes or details for the same customer. Marketing might store segmentation data that's not available in Sales or Support records.
## Data Quality Issues: 
Inaccurate or outdated information might be present in one department but not in another, leading to inconsistencies. For example, the phone number might be updated in the Customer Support system but not in the Sales system.
