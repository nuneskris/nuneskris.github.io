Data is stored and managed in desperate data stores and are not automatically integrated together. 

Integrated data refers to the process of combining data from different sources and providing a unified view. This process is crucial for organizations that need to analyze data from multiple systems or departments to make informed decisions. Integrated data ensures consistency, accuracy, and completeness by merging data into a cohesive dataset.

# The 7 dimensions of Data Integration
Data integration involves several challenges and considerations, especially when dealing with the complexities of modern data environments. These challenges can be categorized into several dimensions often referred to as the "7 Vs" of Data (including Big): Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, Veracity, Visualization, and Value.

For instance, ensuring that customer identifiers match across Sales and Marketing systems (Volume, Variety, and Veracity), processing customer data in real-time for personalized marketing campaigns (Velocity), and visualizing integrated customer profiles for better decision-making (Visualization) all contribute to achieving significant business value (Value).

## Volume
The sheer amount of data generated and stored across different systems can be overwhelming. Integrating large volumes of data from multiple sources requires robust infrastructure and scalable solutions.
## Velocity
The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed is critical. Real-time or near-real-time data integration can be challenging, especially when different systems operate at different paces.
## Variety
Data comes in various formats and structures, from structured databases to unstructured text and multimedia. Integrating such diverse data types into a cohesive system requires sophisticated data transformation and normalization techniques.
## Variability
Data can vary in meaning and context, even within the same system. This inconsistency can lead to challenges in interpreting and integrating data accurately across different sources.
## Veracity
Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data is paramount. Data from different systems might have varying levels of quality, leading to potential issues with trustworthiness and consistency.
## Visualization
Effectively visualizing integrated data is essential for making informed decisions. Tools and techniques for data visualization help in presenting complex, integrated data in an accessible and understandable format.
## Value
The ultimate goal of data integration is to derive meaningful insights and value from the data. This involves not only combining data but also analyzing it to extract actionable intelligence that can drive business decisions.
