We defined what is [integrated data](https://nuneskris.github.io/portfolio/1-1-2IntegratedData/). We need a model to act like a guide or a map which we can use to navigate how data is structured across the various domains use it to as a guide to integrate these various domains into a single unified view to achive integrated data.

A Unified Data Model is an inclusive data framework that consolidates and standardizes the structure of data across an organization. It brings together different data models from various sources into a single, coherent structure. This unified model is designed to accommodate both the commonalities and the unique aspects of different data sets, allowing for consistency and compatibility across various data systems.
