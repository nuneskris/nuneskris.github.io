We need to ensure all the needed capabilites of data such as availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization are delivered based on what was prescribed. This involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards to ensure data is accurate, consistent, and accessible. We need to make informed decisions, comply with regulations, and protect sensitive information. This is done through data Governance needs to be a ***realistic*** and ***pragmatic***.

Just like we govern anything large and complex, we would need to beakdown things downs into smaller governable units. We ***structure ownership*** to ensure funding and accountability on the data. Irrespective of the size of the organization, there is a major shift towards a federated data architecture where data is managed within domains. This is reflected in the rise of Logical data warehouses (connect) architectures and data mesh, and made possible with cloud data platform technologies. Designing domain structures by respecting and aligning to organization dynamics reduces impedance and promotes accountability. The structures would need to include roles and responsibilities defined such as data owners, data stewards, and data custodians, along with their responsibilities.

We cannot govern everything. We need a platform to prioritize data capabilities which are important to the business needs so that implementation efforts are appropriately sponsored. These ***decisions*** are based on organization's data strategy and this governing body would need to resolve priority conflicts across the governable units and arbitrate consensus on how data is described, organized, integrated and shared.

Finally we would need a mechanism to enforce decisions are appropirately implemented within the governable units and measure outcomes from them. We would need ***manage performance*** based on objectives set on these governable units to deliver data management disciplines such Data quality, Data Integration, Master Data, MetaData Management and Data Product Management.

Governance = Operating Model (Structure, Decision Management and Performance) + Policy

Policy â€”> Context : Decision : Consequence
Types of policies
1. Isolation, Access Control, Security
2. Discoverability, Documentation. Interoperability
3. Privacy & Compliance, Quality, Audit/Monitoring
4. Ownership, Contracts, Funding
