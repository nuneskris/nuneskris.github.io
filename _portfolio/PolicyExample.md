# Context
Our organization handles various types of customer data, including sensitive personal information. 
To comply with data protection regulations and ensure customer trust, we must implement strict data retention policies.
# Decision
Customer data will be retained for a maximum of seven years from the date of the last transaction. 
After this period, the data will be securely deleted from all storage systems.
# Consequence
Failing to adhere to this policy will result in data being kept longer than necessary, potentially leading to non-compliance with data protection regulations, increased storage costs, and higher risk of data breaches. 
Compliance audits will be conducted regularly, and any discrepancies will result in disciplinary actions and mandatory retraining for responsible employees.
