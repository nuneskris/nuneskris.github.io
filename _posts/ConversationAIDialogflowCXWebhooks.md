I exaplined [setup of DialogflowCX ](https://nuneskris.github.io/teaching/DialogFlowCXCloudFunction) and exlpained how to create a conversational flow design and demonstrated how NLU can interpret user requests and understand context. I finally used Entities and Intents to navigate and use variables as parameters from the user.

This will not focus on machine learning but will provide integrations to Dialogflow which is an Conversational AI Platform.
