# [Explaining things simply is crucial](https://nuneskris.github.io/portfolio/)
I believe that the simpler I can explain things, the more intimate I am with the topic. The better I explain a topic to someone unfamiliar with it, the better I understand it myself. Simple explanations ensure the message is clear and easily understood by a wider audience. Ideas need acceptance from large audiences within the organization to become reality. By simplifying explanations, we make ideas accessible to people with varying expertise, encouraging engagement. This avoids confusion, saves time, and promotes quicker comprehension and decision-making. Simple explanations also help uncover flaws, improve concepts, and aid retention, fostering innovation. This foundation allows for deeper concepts to be built upon.

# Patent
Background: For Boeing to realize its strategy of expanding to a global workforce, exporting technology data across their engineers and suppliers needs to be tightly controlled by complex license EAR and ITAR agreements with the US government. These license agreements are legal documents which detail what technology data can be exported to which country, organization/individual and under what conditions. These agreements need to be manually read by Boeing’s Global Trade Controls to determine export, which comes with long delays. Automation of extracting the rules and conditions from the documents would reduce these inefficiencies.
 
Technology Challenge: The license agreement which are PDF text or images are a combination of semi structured and full text legal language with multiple document sections dependent on each other. Features or data attributes needed to be extracted from these documents with high accuracy, to build out rules under which technology data can be exported. There was no tool or technology which was available to handle this complexity.

I was responsible to pilot Boeing’s machine learning platform, led a team to build and engineer the solution and finally establish confidence from compliance organization on the viability of the solution. Additionally I have a patent on the solution provided.
 
Patent Summary: A method for training a filter-based text recognition system for cataloging image portions associated with files using text from the image portions, the method comprising: receiving a first set of text represented in a first image portion associated with a first file; classifying the first image portion into a predetermined group, where in the classifying is based at least in part on the first set of text; extracting a first set of features from the first set of text; harmonizing existing data in the predetermined group with the first set of text to modify the first set of features; categorizing the first set of text; and determining analytics-based rules based at least in part on the first set of features.
