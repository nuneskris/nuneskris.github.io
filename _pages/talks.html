We need repeatable processes and patterns for designing, building, and maintaining systems that enable the architecture to collect, store, and process large volumes of data. These data pipelines must ensure that data is accessible, reliable, and efficiently available for analysis and decision-making. My goal is to demonstrate how tools and technologies can implement these processes and patterns throughout the data lifecycle, from source to destination, while maintaining quality, scalability, and security.
